# IB Keyword Search

## Project Description
This Project was created to help teachers in the IB program find questions from past IB tests so that they can create tests more efficiently.

If the keyword was found new tabs will pop up with a sorted list of papers organized by whether they are paper 1, 2, or 3. 
Each paper name is a link, to open a pdf click on the paper name and the pdf will open in your default editor. Because of this, it may take some time to open depending on your default pdf editor. The questions that contain the keyword in them will show up in the tab that used to say "Question Numbers will appear here".

There is an instructions button that will pop up a tab where users can look at the instructions while using the program.

Before searching a second time REMEBER to delete the tabs containing the test questions from paper 1 to paper 3 because those are not ultimately deleted.

## Warning/Errors
### If you can't find the keyword in the question
Each question usually has multiple parts and can span multiple pages so if you can't find the keyword keep scrolling down until you see the next question.

If that doesn't work...

Once in a while for some specific papers the program cannot output the right questions that contain the keyword. If this happens type Cmd+F on Mac and type in the keyword to search for the keyword using the default editor.

### Keyword was not found
![Screenshot of "Keyword was not found" alert window](/img/notFoundErr.png)
If the tab "Keyword was not found" pops up for a search try entering a different search term IB may word their questions differently.

If that doesn't work...

IB tends to be biased towards some topics so there is a chance that IB hasn't had a question on that topic yet. Or some topics like Physics don't usually contain the keyword in the question and IB leaves the students to figure out what topic or skill to use to solve the problem.
